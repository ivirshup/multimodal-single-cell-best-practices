  abstract  = "Single-cell transcriptomics can profile thousands of cells in a
               single experiment and identify novel cell types, states and
               dynamics in a wide variety of tissues and organisms. Standard
               experimental protocols and analysis workflows have been
               developed to create single-cell transcriptomic maps from
               tissues. This tutorial focuses on how to interpret these data to
               identify cell types, states and other biologically relevant
               patterns with the objective of creating an annotated map of
               cells. We recommend a three-step workflow including automatic
               cell annotation (wherever possible), manual cell annotation and
               verification. Frequently encountered challenges are discussed,
               as well as strategies to address them. Guiding principles and
               specific recommendations for software tools and resources that
               can be used for each step are covered, and an R notebook is
               included to help run the recommended workflow. Basic familiarity
               with computer software is assumed, and basic knowledge of
               programming (e.g., in the R language) is recommended.",
